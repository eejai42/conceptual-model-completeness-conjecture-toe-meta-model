### 

## Overview
A model integrating physics and chemistry to represent minerals, rock formations, and tectonic processes.

**Schema Overview:**
- **Mineral**: Basic mineral with chemical composition, crystal structure, etc.
- **RockFormation**: A body of rock with one or more minerals, geologic age, etc.
- **FormationMineralMapping**: Bridge many minerals to many rock formations
- **TectonicPlate**: Major or minor plate in Earth's lithosphere, referencing geometry if needed.
- **PlateBoundaryEvent**: Captures interactions between tectonic plates (divergent, convergent, transform).
