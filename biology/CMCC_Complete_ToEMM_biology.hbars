**Schema Overview:**
- **Gene**: Represents a segment of DNA with regulatory + coding regions, etc.
- **Protein**: A polypeptide chain. Optionally references a Molecule record in chemistry-schema if modeled at that level.
- **Cell**: Basic cellular entity containing genes, proteins, or referencing molecules. Could be prokaryote or eukaryote.
- **CellGeneMapping**: Bridging table for which genes exist in which cell, toy model ignoring diploidy, etc.
- **CellProteinMapping**: Bridging table for which proteins exist in which cell, plus concentration or copy number info.
- **MetabolicReaction**: A biological reaction that references a chemistry Reaction for stoichiometry, plus an enzyme (Protein).
