# Baseball ToE Meta-Model
## A 100% Declarative Framework for the Sport's Structures and Rules

A unified meta-model capturing the entire domain of baseball—teams, players, games, innings, stats, and rules—within a purely declarative structure. All domain logic—like scoring, outs, pitch outcomes, lineups, or statistics—are expressed using lookups, aggregations, constraints, and event-based facts—no imperative instructions.

### Abstract
The Baseball extension of the CMCC (Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture) systematically represents baseball’s core objects—Teams, Players, Games, Innings, At-Bats—under a single Snapshot-Consistent schema. We’ve rewritten the entire specification to be 100% declarative, replacing stepwise imperative logic with event-based or aggregator-based facts. Everything from run scoring, outs, pitch results, and roster assignments is specified as constraints, lookups, aggregator fields, or derived booleans—ensuring that the model is purely descriptive. No domain logic is expressed as do-this-then-do-that instructions.

### Key Points
- Models baseball’s entire rule structure—teams, rosters, innings, batting orders, stats—declaratively with aggregator formulas, event-based facts, and constraints.
- Eliminates the need for any imperative code blocks or specialized DSL instructions.
- Demonstrates flexibility for advanced sabermetrics, tying directly into this purely factual data structure.
- Seamlessly integrates with other CMCC domains (e.g., economics or sociology) for cross-domain synergy.

### Implications
- Provides a universal environment for capturing baseball rules in a purely fact-based manner.
- Greatly simplifies or eliminates stateful code, since all logic is derived from the presence/absence of events or stated data.
- Supports advanced analytics—once in the data, aggregator fields can unify everything from pitch-level detail to multi-season advanced metrics.

### Narrative
#### Purely Declarative Baseball Extension
In this version, we removed all imperative instructions (e.g., 'increment outs', 'set status') and replaced them with aggregator fields or constraints referencing new event entities or pre-existing relationships. For instance, an InningHalf’s outs are now simply the count of 'OutEvent' records referencing that half-inning. A game is 'in progress' if certain conditions in the data hold (status='IN_PROGRESS' AND we haven't reached final conditions). No procedure calls are needed to change states; the data itself drives the logic. This architecture helps ensure the system remains consistent and transparent: any change to the data is automatically reflected in the aggregator fields, with no hidden or procedural steps to update them.
