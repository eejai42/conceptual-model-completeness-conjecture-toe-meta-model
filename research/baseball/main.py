"""
A CLI tool (main.py) that demonstrates using a hypothetical baseball CMCC SDK.
We assume there's a sibling file named baseball-cmcc-sdk.py that exposes
classes/functions like 'Game', 'Inning', 'Player' with declarative logic.

This script:
1) Creates a new game.
2) Starts the first inning.
3) Gets the first player at bat.
4) Simulates a strikeout.
5) Moves to the next batter.
