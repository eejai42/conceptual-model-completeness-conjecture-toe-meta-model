We’ve rewritten the entire specification to be 100% declarative, replacing stepwise imperative logic with event-based or aggregator-based facts. Everything from run scoring, outs, pitch results, and roster assignments is specified as constraints, lookups, aggregator fields, or derived booleans—ensuring that the model is purely descriptive. No domain logic is expressed as do-this-then-do-that instructions.",

                "In this version, we removed all imperative instructions (e.g., 'increment outs', 'set status') and replaced them with aggregator fields or constraints referencing new event entities or pre-existing relationships. For instance, an InningHalf’s outs are now simply the count of 'OutEvent' records referencing that half-inning. A game is 'in progress' if certain conditions in the data hold (status='IN_PROGRESS' AND we haven't reached final conditions). No procedure calls are needed to change states; the data itself drives the logic. This architecture helps ensure the system remains consistent and transparent: any change to the data is automatically reflected in the aggregator fields, with no hidden or procedural steps to update them."

All game states—outs, runs, or game completion—are determined by the presence of event records and aggregator formulas. We introduced entities like OutEvent and RunEvent for outs and runs, so that at any time, the system can see 'outs=3' or 'runs>opponentRuns' and derive that an inning/game is finished. No imperative instruction is needed to 'increment' or 'set' these values; they follow naturally from the underlying event data.",
                  "This approach underscores the power of the CMCC framework (S, D, L, A, F). The domain structure is expressed via the schema (S), actual values or events appear in the data (D), references or relationships are lookups (L), aggregator fields (A) compute rollups or derived states, and lambda fields (F) can define purely functional or constraint-based logic. The entire baseball domain logic emerges from these relationships—no custom code is required to orchestrate state transitions."
