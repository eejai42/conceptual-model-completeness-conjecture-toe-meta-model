# Quantum Interpretations Unified Meta-Model

This folder contains the **JSON schema** for a unified model that simultaneously accommodates **Copenhagen**, **Many-Worlds**, and **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**. Our goal is to highlight how all three interpretations can be represented in a **single, coherent data structure**, with the **interpretation differences** handled by separate policies and branching logic.

## Contents

1. **`unified_quantum_model.json`**  
   - The main JSON file defining:
     - **QuantumState** (shared wavefunction data)
     - **InterpretationPolicy** (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, RQM policies)
     - **MeasurementEvent** (handles measurement records)
     - **ObserverFrame** (for RQM vantage points)
     - **BranchRecord** (branching data for Many-Worlds or partial RQM scenarios)

2. **Supporting Documents**  
   - *(If you have additional text or PDF docs, link them here. E.g., `docs/QuantumInterpretations.md` for extra theoretical background.)*

## Model Overview

### QuantumState
- Represents a **wavefunction** (amplitude data), plus references to an **InterpretationPolicy**.  
- Includes calculated fields (like `normalization`) to ensure wavefunction integrity, and can roll up multiple branches (via `BranchRecord`) if the policy is Many-Worlds or partial branching.

### InterpretationPolicy
- Stores **which interpretation** applies:  
  - **Copenhagen** (single-outcome collapse)  
  - **ManyWorlds** (branch on each measurement)  
  - **RQM** (observer-relative measurement)  
- Potentially includes a `metadata` field for custom configuration (e.g. “preferred basis” or “branch weighting”).

### MeasurementEvent
- Records an **observation** on a given wavefunction.  
- Can produce single-outcome collapse, multiple branches, or observer-specific outcomes, depending on the policy.  
- Defines an aggregator to compute outcome probabilities (`outcome_probabilities`) and a lambda (`execute_measurement`) to apply the chosen logic.

### ObserverFrame
- Important in **RQM**, storing partial knowledge or vantage points.  
- May also store transformations (like coordinate frames, reference times) if you extend it.  
- Provides ways to see how different observers converge on (or remain ignorant of) each other’s states.

### BranchRecord
- A **branch** is a wavefunction “slice” that emerges after a measurement event (Many-Worlds) or partial branching (some RQM formulations).  
- Each branch includes amplitude data, a `prob_weight`, and optionally tracking depth or a link to its parent branch.

## Getting Started

1. **Place the JSON schema** (`unified_quantum_model.json`) in your project’s data or schema folder.
2. **Read or parse** it in your application or analysis tool.  
   - Make sure your environment can interpret JSON-based data models (e.g., a custom DSL engine, a no-code platform, or a knowledge graph system).
3. **Attach a runtime** that interprets:
   - **Copenhagen**: collapses wavefunction to a single outcome in `MeasurementEvent`.
   - **Many-Worlds**: spawns new `BranchRecord`s for each outcome.
   - **RQM**: logs outcome in a specific `ObserverFrame` without globally discarding other outcomes.

## Example Usage Flow

1. **Initialize** a `QuantumState` with amplitude data for your system.
2. **Link** it to an `InterpretationPolicy` (e.g. `"collapse_behavior": "branch"` for Many-Worlds).
3. **Create** a `MeasurementEvent` with an `observable_operator`.
4. **Call** the `execute_measurement` lambda, which:
   - Checks the policy’s `collapse_behavior`.
   - Either picks one outcome or spawns multiple branches, or records an observer-relative partial outcome.
5. **Observe** changes in `BranchRecord` (if Many-Worlds) or in `ObserverFrame` (if RQM).
6. **Repeat** as more measurements occur.

## Extending the Model

- **Add a `time_evolution` aggregator** in `QuantumState` for approximate Schrödinger equation steps.
- **Add advanced constraints** for forced decoherence or partial tracing if you want open-system modeling.
- **Implement concurrency** by merging multiple wavefunctions if they become entangled, referencing a shared measurement event, etc.

## Contributing

1. **Fork or clone** this repository if you have additional improvements to the JSON schema.
2. **Propose** new fields, lambdas, or aggregations for advanced quantum phenomena (like entanglement entropy, partial trace over subsystems, etc.).
3. **Submit** a pull request or open an issue describing your changes.

Feel free to adapt it to your own quantum research or application—**the beauty of a unified schema** is that you can pivot between interpretations **without** rewriting the entire data model!
