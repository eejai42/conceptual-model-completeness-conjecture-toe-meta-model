# CMCC Research Efforts

[Home](../README.md)

All of these different domains cooperate effortlessly under the same 
unbrella because of the Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture, and 
the power of the 5 primitives that it posites are sufficient to capture
the declarative semantics for any conceptual model.

### The Business Rule Completeness Conjecture (BRCC)
#### Eliminating the “Ripple Effect” in Model Evolution

BRCC simplifies business rule management by eliminating the ripple effect of changes, ensuring rules are consistent and easy to maintain.

**Domain Experts:**  
BRCC posits that any finite business rule can be decomposed using five declarative primitives in an ACID-compliant environment, decoupling design-time semantics from runtime execution.

### Triangleness in an ACID Datastore

Abstract
This paper demonstrates how the declarative semantics of a simple mathematical concept—triangleness—can be fully captured using five primitives (Schema, Data, Lookups, Aggregations, and Lambda Calculated Fields) in an ACID-compliant environment. By walking through a step-by-step example in Airtable, we illustrate how even fundamental geometric properties (e.g. side lengths, angles, and the Pythagorean theorem) can be represented purely declaratively, with time as just another dimension. This example serves as an approachable gateway to the Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture (CMCC), which posits that any computable object or business rule can be modeled in this same manner—no external syntaxes or domain-specific languages required.
We begin by gradually building up the notion of “triangleness” in an Airtable base, highlighting how second- and third-order inferences (e.g., detecting right angles, verifying a² + b² = c² emerge naturally from the five primitives. Next, we discuss whether there exist more complex mathematical objects that defy this approach. In doing so, we segue into the theoretical underpinnings of CMCC, referencing Turing-completeness arguments to show why the conjecture holds for a broad range of domains. Finally, we compare CMCC to related work in knowledge representation, model-driven engineering, and computational universality. We conclude by inviting readers to propose counterexamples—highlighting the falsifiability of CMCC—and outline future directions for a fully declarative, syntax-free approach to modeling mathematics, enterprise logic, and beyond.

### The Linguistic Completeness Conjecture (LCC)
#### From Syntax-Bound Semantics to Universal Declarative Mirrors

The Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture (CMCC) posits that any finite, computable concept—including linguistic meaning—can be fully captured using five declarative primitives: Schema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F), all within an ACID-compliant datastore. When applied to language, this principle yields the Linguistic Completeness Conjecture (LCC), asserting that semantics can be represented independently of linguistic syntax. CMCC-based conceptual models act as universal “mirrors” of meaning—hyperdimensional structures reflecting conceptual reality—rather than relying on one-dimensional strings of symbols. Crucially, this does not eliminate human language for communication or documentation; instead, it decouples stored knowledge from syntax-laden text.

By introducing a third semiotic category—beyond Saussure’s (1916) signifier and signified—LCC reframes core linguistic theories, including Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (Chomsky 1965, 1993) and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (Sapir 1921; Whorf 1956), into a syntax-free conceptual paradigm. The paper provides illustrative examples (e.g., “triangleness”) and explores how formal semantics (such as intensional logic and modality) can fit comfortably in this declarative framework. We further outline an empirical path using platforms like Airtable or Baserow—demonstrating feasibility and falsifiability. Readers are invited to propose counterexamples that defy LCC, thus testing whether any finite computable linguistic phenomenon truly escapes this syntax-free universal mirror.
