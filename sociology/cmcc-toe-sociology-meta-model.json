CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, “But will it work for my domain?”: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",

This progression ensures that readers—technical or otherwise—understand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can’t unsee its potential everywhere else."

I have absolutely no idea HOW it works, but that doesn't really matter since that's not its role in this process.  Its role is to define a high-fidelity, hyper-dimensional model that DEFINES Truth.  On the other end of the spectrum we have Reality Itself, which might as well also be magical, at least at the quantum fringes.  Here again—our models don't describe HOW the wave collapses, but WHAT a wave collapse is.

The first type of change is one where the domain is simply being extended.  In these cases, the CI/CD pipeline will pick up those changes and they will simply be deployed to the dev/test environment.  By contrast, if the domain itself is changed, because changing the schema or rules for a domain is a fundamentally different CATEGORY of change than simply adding another widget to the tens of thousands of widgets that are already in the datastore."
