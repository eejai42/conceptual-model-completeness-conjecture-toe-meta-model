# Sociology & Anthropology ToE Meta-Model
## A Declarative Framework for Modeling Social Dynamics and Cultural Norms

A unified meta-model capturing social structures, cultural norms, and interaction networks. This model encodes survey data, demographic records, and social network relationships, and enables predictive modeling of social behavior and network dynamics.

### Abstract
This meta-model represents social structures, cultural norms, and interaction networks in a syntax‐free, ACID‐compliant environment. By leveraging declarative primitives, it supports community health indexing, social cohesion metrics, and predictive modeling of network dynamics.
