**Schema Overview:**
- **TrainingDataset**: Dataset used to train AI models, referencing domain/size.
- **NeuralNetworkModel**: Stores metadata for a trained or untrained neural network model.
- **InferenceEvent**: Represents a single inference/prediction call made to a trained AI model.
- **ReinforcementAgent**: Stores an RL agent’s policy and environment references.
