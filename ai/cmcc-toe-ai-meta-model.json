CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, “But will it work for my domain?”: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",

This progression ensures that readers—technical or otherwise—understand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can’t unsee its potential everywhere else."
