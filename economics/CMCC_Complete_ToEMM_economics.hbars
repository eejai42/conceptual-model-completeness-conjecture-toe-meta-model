**Schema Overview:**
- **EconomicAgent**: Individual or organization participating in an economy.
- **GoodOrService**: A product or service being traded in the economy.
- **Market**: A marketplace or exchange for a particular good/service. Summaries for supply, demand, etc.
- **Transaction**: Represents a supply or demand action by an agent in a market.
