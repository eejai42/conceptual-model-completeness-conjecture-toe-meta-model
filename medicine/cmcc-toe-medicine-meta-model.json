It applies equally to geometry, biology, legal rules, quantum theories, or inventory systems. In short, if a rule can be stated in any imperative language (or in English), it can be modeled structurally under CMCC without loss of fidelity."

Modeling “triangleness” is trivial in Airtable; modeling advanced governance or physics follows the same structural pattern. CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, “But will it work for my domain?”: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",
            "In sum, we move from a short English description of a concept, to a self-describing Airtable model, culminating in the CMCC theorem that guarantees we can handle any conceptual domain the same way. This progression ensures that readers—technical or otherwise—understand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can’t unsee its potential everywhere else."

If there are a list of 100 true statements, and you add another statement - you will either now have 101 true statements, or the inferences of 1 or more of the previous statements will conflict, pointing to a problem with the conceptual model, rather than the description.  By just listing true things about WHAT is needed, it leaves the question of HOW to make that true up to the runtime engine.",

In other words, the CMCC model can represent WHAT needs to happen at virtually any level of desired functionality - as a result it can export DSLs, RDF, OWL, Sparql, GraphQL, etc. making the CMCC model a superset of legacy, language based, syntax-locked formats.",

Using Airtable to define business rules works for all but the most extreme concepts, but all it defines is exactly WHAT needs to be done.  HOW Airtable works might as well be magic.  I have absolutely no idea HOW it works, but that doesn't really matter since that's not its role in this process.  Its role is to define a high-fidelity, hyper-dimensional model that DEFINES Truth.  On the other end of the spectrum we have Reality Itself, which might as well also be magical, at least at the quantum fringes.  Here again—our models don't describe HOW the wave collapses, but WHAT a wave collapse is.  Or WHAT a Customer is, and WHAT makes them a VIP customer—not how we compute if they are a VIP in some AWS server.  VIP customers are still going to be anyone with over $1000 of sales—that is the part that's invariant.",

Additionally, the types of changes that can be made to the model are also separated into two radically different types by another BRIGHT RED LINE.  The first type of change is one where the domain is simply being extended.  In these cases, the CI/CD pipeline will pick up those changes and they will simply be deployed to the dev/test environment.  By contrast, if the domain itself is changed, because changing the schema or rules for a domain is a fundamentally different CATEGORY of change than simply adding another widget to the tens of thousands of widgets that are already in the datastore."
