**Schema Overview:**
- **PhysicalConstants**: Stores fundamental constants (Planck, c, G, Boltzmann, etc.) possibly with uncertainties.
- **ReferenceFrame**: Coordinate system definition, e.g. 3D classical or 4D Minkowski.
- **Potential**: For classical or quantum usage, e.g. harmonic oscillator or gravitational well.
- **Hamiltonian**: Stores T + V for quantum or classical contexts. E.g. p^2/2m + potential.
- **Wavefunction**: Single or multi-particle wavefunction, storing discrete amplitude data or references.
- **Particle**: Classical or quantum entity. Use bridging table for multi-particle wavefunctions.
- **ParticleWavefunctionMapping**: For multi-particle wavefunctions, bridging table references each Particle to the same Wavefunction record.
- **DensityMatrix**: Stores ρ for a (sub)system, possibly partial trace of multi-particle wavefunction.
- **Force**: Classical force on a particle. Aggregations can unify with quantum if we wish.
- **GaugeField**: Stores e.g. (E,B) or (Aμ) for a U(1), SU(3), etc. Physical observables must be gauge-invariant.
- **MeasurementEvent**: Records an observation, can produce multiple wavefunction branches in a fully declarative manner.
- **ClassicalSystem**: Groups multiple particles. Summarizes total mass, momentum, energy, etc.
- **SpacetimeMetric**: Stores a 3+1 or 4D metric. Einstein eq aggregator referencing total stress-energy, etc.
- **BlackHoleSystem**: Entity for horizon radius, Hawking temp, etc., referencing total mass.
