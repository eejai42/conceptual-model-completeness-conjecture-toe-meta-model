**Schema Overview:**
- **Atom**: Represents a single element or ion, referencing the underlying physics Particle optionally.
- **Bond**: Represents a chemical bond between two atoms (intra-molecular or otherwise).
- **Molecule**: Collection of atoms connected by bonds, plus optional reference to quantum wavefunction.
- **MoleculeAtomMapping**: Bridging table for many-to-many: which atoms belong to which molecule and in what count (for coarse stoichiometric models).
- **Reaction**: A chemical reaction with references to reactants, products, and optional details.
- **ReactionParticipant**: Bridging entity for Reaction, specifying which Molecule is a reactant or product.
