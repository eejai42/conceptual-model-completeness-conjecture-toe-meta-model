Demonstrating Turing-completeness and aligning with Wolfram‚Äôs multiway systems, CMCC provides a universal substrate for modeling domains ranging from physics and biology to business rules and beyond. This paper formalizes CMCC‚Äôs theoretical foundations, presents diverse cross-domain examples, and outlines future directions for building a unified computational framework.",

It applies equally to geometry, biology, legal rules, quantum theories, or inventory systems.

Modeling ‚Äútriangleness‚Äù is trivial in Airtable; modeling advanced governance or physics follows the same structural pattern. CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, ‚ÄúBut will it work for my domain?‚Äù: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",
            "In sum, we move from a short English description of a concept, to a self-describing Airtable model, culminating in the CMCC theorem that guarantees we can handle any conceptual domain the same way. This progression ensures that readers‚Äîtechnical or otherwise‚Äîunderstand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can‚Äôt unsee its potential everywhere else."
