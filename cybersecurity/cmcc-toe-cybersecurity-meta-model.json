            "By decoupling the “what” from specific syntax, teams eliminate the repeated translation tasks that plague large projects. Modeling “triangleness” is trivial in Airtable; modeling advanced governance or physics follows the same structural pattern. CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, “But will it work for my domain?”: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",
            "In sum, we move from a short English description of a concept, to a self-describing Airtable model, culminating in the CMCC theorem that guarantees we can handle any conceptual domain the same way. This progression ensures that readers—technical or otherwise—understand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can’t unsee its potential everywhere else."
