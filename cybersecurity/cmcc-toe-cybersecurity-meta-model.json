            "By decoupling the “what” from specific syntax, teams eliminate the repeated translation tasks that plague large projects. Modeling “triangleness” is trivial in Airtable; modeling advanced governance or physics follows the same structural pattern. CMCC solidifies the principle that once we master a small example (like a triangle), we unlock the ability to describe any computable concept. This puts an end to the question, “But will it work for my domain?”: the moment we acknowledge that geometry itself can be captured in a purely structural format, all similarly computable rules become fair game.",
            "In sum, we move from a short English description of a concept, to a self-describing Airtable model, culminating in the CMCC theorem that guarantees we can handle any conceptual domain the same way. This progression ensures that readers—technical or otherwise—understand why syntax-free, declarative modeling is both feasible and transformative. Once you see it work with triangles, you can’t unsee its potential everywhere else."

      "what_not_how": "It's just a list of statements about WHAT is true at any given moment in time.  If there are a list of 100 true statements, and you add another statement - you will either now have 101 true statements, or the inferences of 1 or more of the previous statements will conflict, pointing to a problem with the conceptual model, rather than the description.  By just listing true things about WHAT is needed, it leaves the question of HOW to make that true up to the runtime engine.",
      "time": "Time is just another dimension.",
      "rulebook_not_the_runtime": "Like a blueprint, or sheet music, the CMCC model is just the rulebook, not the runtime engine.  The runtime engine could be an existing digital twin of some reality that is simply Fed by the CMCC.  In other words, the CMCC model can represent WHAT needs to happen at virtually any level of desired functionality - as a result it can export DSLs, RDF, OWL, Sparql, GraphQL, etc. making the CMCC model a superset of legacy, language based, syntax-locked formats.",
      "scaleability_performance": "As just the rulebook, the implementation can be assembler code written by magical mice in the night if that's the best solution.  But whatever they produce had better pass **all** of the tests derived directly from the CMCC model itself.  As long as it does WHAT it is meant to, how it does it is up to the runtime engine.  If that digital twin involves petabytes of raw data, coming in a gb per second - that's going to be a monumental engineering task.  But whatever the solution at runtime, it just needs to do WHAT is required.",
      "reality_is_the_best_runtime_engine": "Ultimately, for physics for example, reality is the runtime engine.  This just provides the model to understand WHAT is happening at runtime.  Using Airtable to define business rules works for all but the most extreme concepts, but all it defines is exactly WHAT needs to be done.  HOW Airtable works might as well be magic.  I have absolutely no idea HOW it works, but that doesn't really matter since that's not its role in this process.  Its role is to define a high-fidelity, hyper-dimensional model that DEFINES Truth.  On the other end of the spectrum we have Reality Itself, which might as well also be magical, at least at the quantum fringes.  Here again—our models don't describe HOW the wave collapses, but WHAT a wave collapse is.  Or WHAT a Customer is, and WHAT makes them a VIP customer—not how we compute if they are a VIP in some AWS server.  VIP customers are still going to be anyone with over $1000 of sales—that is the part that's invariant.",
      "bright_red_lines": "Separating out WHAT is true from HOW to make it true at runtime draws a BRIGHT RED LINE about what KIND of change is being made.  Additionally, the types of changes that can be made to the model are also separated into two radically different types by another BRIGHT RED LINE.  The first type of change is one where the domain is simply being extended.  In these cases, the CI/CD pipeline will pick up those changes and they will simply be deployed to the dev/test environment.  By contrast, if the domain itself is changed, because changing the schema or rules for a domain is a fundamentally different CATEGORY of change than simply adding another widget to the tens of thousands of widgets that are already in the datastore."
