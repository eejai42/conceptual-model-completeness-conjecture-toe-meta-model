# The CMCC Complete Theory-of-Everything Meta Model

## Overview
This repo contains a self describing model for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, AI Knowledge Management, Economics and more. These are all unified under one common CMCC Complete model, a conjecture that posits that the declarative semantics of any conceptual model can be captured using five fundamental primitives‚ÄîSchema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)‚Äîwithin an ACID-compliant environment. Demonstrating Turing-completeness and aligning with Wolfram‚Äôs multiway systems, CMCC provides a universal substrate for modeling domains ranging from physics and biology to business rules and beyond. This paper formalizes CMCC‚Äôs theoretical foundations, presents diverse cross-domain examples, and outlines future directions for building a unified computational framework

## TL;DR;
### The Model

To skip the rigamarole, and just cut to the chase, this is the [CMCC ToE Meta-Model](SSoT/cmcc-toe-meta-model.json).

The Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture (CMCC) provides a unified, self‚Äêdescribing framework for modeling domains as diverse as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, AI Knowledge Management, and Economics. Underpinned by five fundamental primitives‚ÄîSchema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)‚Äîthe CMCC model is both declarative and operational. It guarantees Turing-completeness and aligns with Wolfram‚Äôs multiway systems, offering a universal substrate for capturing the "what" of domain knowledge while leaving the "how" to the runtime.

## üî¥ HARDCORE CMCC FALSIFICATION CHECKLIST

‚ö†Ô∏è STOP! BEFORE YOU CLAIM CMCC FAILS, DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU ACTUALLY DID THIS: ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚úÖ Step 1: DO NOT LIST 5 POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
   (Red Flags: IF your falsification attempt includes words like Could, May, Might, or Maybe, that is not a falsification, it is a presupposition - that is going to melt away under scrutiny)

‚úÖ Step 2: PICK THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS RULE THAT YOU THINK BREAKS CMCC
   (Write it down. If you didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre just assuming failure instead of testing it.)

‚úÖ Step 3: DECOMPOSE IT INTO CMCC PRIMITIVES (S, D, L, A, F)
   (Write how it could be represented declaratively. If you skipped this, you didn‚Äôt actually test it.)

‚úÖ Step 4: CHECK IF THE RUNTIME ENGINE CAN HANDLE IT
üí° Remember: CMCC defines the WHAT, not the HOW. The runtime executes the rules. Performance, and scaling are runtime concerns. Is your rule actually a runtime concern? 

‚úÖ Step 5: IF YOU STILL THINK IT FAILS, TRY AGAIN
   Seriously. Every time I thought I falsified it, I realized I was looking at it wrong. Are you sure you aren‚Äôt just assuming imperative execution is required?

üöÄ IF YOU STILL THINK CMCC FAILS‚Ä¶ EMAIL ME YOUR CASE!
   (And expect me to ask if you really followed these steps. üòÇ)

## Theory of Everything (TOE) Domains

Below is a list of TOE models included in this repository. Click on any domain to read its detailed meta-model documentation:


## Example: Mathematical Details

The Mathematics TOE Meta-Model illustrates how fundamental mathematical concepts are declaratively defined. For example:

### Sets
- **Definition:** A Set is a fundamental collection of mathematical objects. It defines the universe in which arithmetic and number theory are formulated.
- **Notable Aggregations:**  
  - *is_empty*: `COUNT(elements) = 0`  
  - *is_finite*: `countable AND cardinality != 'aleph_0'`
- **Lambda Functions:**  
  - *subset*: `CreateSet(elements.filter(predicate))`  
  - *power_set*: `GenerateAllSubsets(this)`

### Functions
- **Definition:** A Function maps a domain Set to a codomain Set and formalizes arithmetic operations and other transformations.
- **Notable Aggregations:**  
  - *is_injective*: `CheckInjectivity(rule)`  
  - *is_surjective*: `CheckSurjectivity(rule, codomain_set_id)`  
  - *is_bijective*: `is_injective AND is_surjective`
- **Lambda Functions:**  
  - *compose*: `ComposeRules(this.rule, LOOKUP(other_function_id).rule)`  
  - *inverse*: `IF is_bijective THEN InvertRule(rule) ELSE null`

### Structures
- **Definition:** Structures formalize algebraic systems (e.g., groups, rings, fields) by combining a base set with defined operations (like addition and multiplication) and relations.
- **Example:**  
  - *Ring of Integers*: Defines a ring over ‚Ñ§ with operations for addition and multiplication, and an equality relation.

These examples (along with many formulas and lambda definitions) illustrate how the model not only documents the domain but also makes it directly executable.
