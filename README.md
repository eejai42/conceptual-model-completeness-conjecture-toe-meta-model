# The CMCC Complete Theory-of-Everything Meta Model

## Overview
This repo contains a self describing model for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, AI Knowledge Management, Economics and more.  These are all unified under one common CMCC Complete model, a conjecture that posits that the declarative semantics of any conceptual model can be captured using five fundamental primitives—Schema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)—within an ACID-compliant environment. Demonstrating Turing-completeness and aligning with Wolfram’s multiway systems, CMCC provides a universal substrate for modeling domains ranging from physics and biology to business rules and beyond. This paper formalizes CMCC’s theoretical foundations, presents diverse cross-domain examples, and outlines future directions for building a unified computational framework

The Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture (CMCC) provides a unified, self‐describing framework for modeling domains as diverse as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, AI Knowledge Management, and Economics. Underpinned by five fundamental primitives—Schema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)—the CMCC model is both declarative and operational. It guarantees Turing-completeness and aligns with Wolfram’s multiway systems, offering a universal substrate for capturing the "what" of domain knowledge while leaving the "how" to the runtime.

## Example: Mathematical Details

The Mathematics TOE Meta-Model illustrates how fundamental mathematical concepts are declaratively defined. For example:

### Sets
- **Definition:** A Set is a fundamental collection of mathematical objects. It defines the universe in which arithmetic and number theory are formulated.
- **Notable Aggregations:**  
  - *is_empty*: `COUNT(elements) = 0`  
  - *is_finite*: `countable AND cardinality != 'aleph_0'`
- **Lambda Functions:**  
  - *subset*: `CreateSet(elements.filter(predicate))`  
  - *power_set*: `GenerateAllSubsets(this)`

### Functions
- **Definition:** A Function maps a domain Set to a codomain Set and formalizes arithmetic operations and other transformations.
- **Notable Aggregations:**  
  - *is_injective*: `CheckInjectivity(rule)`  
  - *is_surjective*: `CheckSurjectivity(rule, codomain_set_id)`  
  - *is_bijective*: `is_injective AND is_surjective`
- **Lambda Functions:**  
  - *compose*: `ComposeRules(this.rule, LOOKUP(other_function_id).rule)`  
  - *inverse*: `IF is_bijective THEN InvertRule(rule) ELSE null`

### Structures
- **Definition:** Structures formalize algebraic systems (e.g., groups, rings, fields) by combining a base set with defined operations (like addition and multiplication) and relations.
- **Example:**  
  - *Ring of Integers*: Defines a ring over ℤ with operations for addition and multiplication, and an equality relation.

These examples (along with many formulas and lambda definitions) illustrate how the model not only documents the domain but also makes it directly executable.
