# The CMCC Complete Theory-of-Everything Meta Model

## Overview
The Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture (CMCC) posits that the declarative semantics of any conceptual model can be captured using five fundamental primitives—Schema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)—within an ACID-compliant environment. Demonstrating Turing-completeness and aligning with Wolfram’s multiway systems, CMCC provides a universal substrate for modeling domains ranging from physics and biology to business rules and beyond. This paper formalizes CMCC’s theoretical foundations, presents diverse cross-domain examples, and outlines future directions for building a unified computational framework.
