# The CMCC Complete Theory-of-Everything Meta Model

## Overview


## Theory of Everything (TOE) Domains
Below is a list of TOE models included in this repository:

- **[CMCC Complete Mathematics ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Math.md)**  
  A structured model covering foundational mathematics, including sets, functions, proofs, structures, and category theory.
- **[CMCC Complete Physics ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Physics.md)**  
  A unified model for physics, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, gauge fields, wavefunctions, relativity, and black hole dynamics.
- **[CMCC Complete Chemistry ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Chemistry.md)**  
  Extends the Physics TOE with atomic structures, molecular interactions, bonds, and chemical reactions.
- **[CMCC Complete Biology ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Biology.md)**  
  Bridges Chemistry and Physics TOEs to model biological systems, including genes, proteins, metabolism, and cellular structures.
- **[CMCC Complete Artificial Intelligence ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_AI.md)**  
  Encapsulates machine learning, neural networks, training datasets, reinforcement learning, and inference mechanisms.
- **[CMCC Complete Economics ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Economics.md)**  
  A computational model for economic agents, markets, transactions, and supply-demand constraints.
- **[CMCC Complete Astronomy ToE Meta-Model](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Astronomy.md)**  
  An extension of the Physics TOE to model celestial bodies, star systems, orbital dynamics, and large-scale cosmic structures.
- **[Geology](./CMCC_Complete_ToEMM_Geology.md)**  
  A model integrating physics and chemistry to represent minerals, rock formations, and tectonic processes.
