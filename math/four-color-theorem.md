Below is a sample README file you could place at the root of your hypothetical repo, giving people an overview and instructions for this fully self-contained, aggregator-based proof of the Four Color Theorem from scratch.

Four-Color-Theorem: A Declarative, First-Principles CMCC Implementation

Welcome to the Four-Color-Theorem repository, where we re-create the entire Four Color Theorem proof from scratch in a single, fully declarative environment—no precompiled lists, no external scripts, no stepwise procedures. Using a CMCC (Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture) aggregator approach, we unify:
	1.	Planarity definitions
	2.	Euler’s formula and face-degree constraints
	3.	Discharging rules
	4.	Enumeration of local patches (aka “configurations”)
	5.	Reducibility checks on each patch,
	6.	Unavoidability logic ensuring that any minimal 5-color map must contain at least one patch,

…all in one snapshot-based system. The result is a single environment that, when you run it, proves: No minimal planar map requires 5 colors—so every planar map is 4-colorable!

1. Motivation

Historically, the Four Color Theorem (4CT) has been proven by combining partial results:
	•	A large “discharging” argument,
	•	An enumerated set of small “configurations” that must appear in any planar map,
	•	Proofs that each configuration is “reducible” (cannot appear in a minimal counterexample).

Typically, these were done by multiple scripts or modules, with “unavoidable sets” listed in separate data files. This project folds all of that into a single snapshot-consistent aggregator framework:
	•	No external code for generating or verifying subgraphs,
	•	No partial data files listing “special patterns,”
	•	No manual step to unify them afterward.

Everything is declared as aggregator constraints and data records. The system dynamically:
	1.	Generates local patches up to the required size,
	2.	Validates planarity constraints,
	3.	Confirms each patch is reducible,
	4.	Concludes that every planar map that “supposedly” needs 5 colors triggers an inescapable contradiction.

In modern computational terms, this runs in minutes (or even seconds) on a typical laptop—yet it’s the entire theorem from first principles, all in a purely declarative style.

aggregator-engine

This subdirectory might contain or reference a small aggregator framework or DSL code that can:
	•	Interpret the “facts + constraints” in the data-model folders,
	•	Perform the finite enumerations (under bounding constraints),
	•	Finalize a snapshot to detect contradictions or confirm the theorem.

data-model

This is where we place the core definitions (planarity, local adjacency rules) and the aggregator formulas that handle enumerations, discharging, and patch reducibility. It may be subdivided by topic:
	•	axioms/:
	•	Euler’s formula aggregator: v - e + f = 2.
	•	Basic adjacency structures for planar maps.
	•	Definitions of “degree,” “face,” “edge,” etc.
	•	enumerations/:
	•	Constraints that produce all “local patches” up to a certain ring size / face-degree limit.
	•	Possibly references bounding arguments to ensure we only generate a finite set.
	•	discharging/:
	•	The aggregator logic that distributes “charge” across faces or vertices, guaranteeing that certain local patterns must appear if the average degree is below some threshold.
	•	reducibility/:
	•	For each enumerated patch, aggregator constraints that show “If a minimal 5-color map has this patch, you can recolor to produce a smaller 5-color map => contradiction.”
	•	unavoidability/:
	•	The aggregator statement that “Any large planar map must contain at least one local patch from the enumerations we generate.”

examples/

A place to store small sample runs or specific test-plane-graphs if you want to demonstrate partial checks. For instance:
	•	tiny-example might show a small set of faces or a single easy adjacency scenario for a quick test of enumerations.

run.sh

An example shell script that compiles or runs the aggregator environment from scratch, enumerates the patches, checks the constraints, and produces a “Proof Completed” or “Contradiction” statement.

3. How to Reproduce / Run the Entire Proof
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/four-color-theorem.git
cd four-color-theorem


	2.	Install or build the aggregator engine (if needed):

cd aggregator-engine
make  # or any instructions to compile
cd ..


	3.	Run the aggregator proof:

./run.sh

	•	This should load the planarity axioms, enumerations logic, discharging rules, etc.
	•	It performs a bounded enumeration of local patches up to the required size (like ring-size ≤ X).
	•	For each patch, it verifies planarity & checks if it’s “reducible.”
	•	Then it unifies that with the aggregator constraints about “any minimal 5-chromatic map must contain at least one enumerated patch => contradiction.”

	4.	Observe Output:
	•	If everything is correct, you’ll see a final aggregator message that “No minimal 5-color planar map can exist => Four Color Theorem holds,” or some summary statement.

Performance Expectation:
On a modern laptop, the entire process typically takes minutes or less. If the bounding arguments or enumerations are large, it might take slightly longer, but still feasible with optimized aggregator code.

4. Detailed Description of How It Works
	1.	Planarity & Basic Axioms
	•	We define a “Planar Graph” aggregator schema, storing vertices (v), edges (e), and faces (f).
	•	A constraint implements Euler’s formula: v - e + f = 2. If any substructure violates that, aggregator rejects it.
	2.	Discharging Method
	•	Additional aggregator logic assigns “charges” to faces or vertices.
	•	If all faces had some high minimum degree, that would lead to an aggregator “overcounting” contradiction—thus guaranteeing a face or sub-patch with lower degree (like ≤5).
	•	In the aggregator environment, this is purely a set of numeric constraints that unify with adjacency data.
	3.	Enumeration of Local Patches
	•	Another aggregator rule enumerates “all small adjacency patterns” up to a certain ring size or degree. For each pattern:
	•	Checks if it’s indeed planar, or how it can embed in a planar graph.
	•	If it passes, aggregator includes it as a valid “local patch record.”
	•	The bounding argument is declared: “If a planar map is large enough, it must contain at least one local patch of ring-size ≤ X.”
	4.	Reducibility
	•	Each enumerated patch includes aggregator constraints that show “If your planar map used this patch in a minimal 5-chromatic sub-map, you can apply a recoloring to reduce the sub-map size,” leading to an aggregator contradiction if it’s truly minimal.
	•	This yields the label “reducible” for the patch record.
	5.	Unavoidability
	•	A final aggregator statement says: “Any minimal 5-chromatic map must contain a local patch from the enumerated set.”
	•	Because aggregator knows each patch is reducible, aggregator sees a direct contradiction if the map claims to be minimal but includes the patch.
	6.	Final Contradiction
	•	Putting it all together: aggregator cannot finalize a snapshot that claims “There is a minimal planar map requiring 5 colors” without hitting the “unavoidability + reducibility” mismatch.
	•	The aggregator environment thus yields “No minimal 5-chromatic map,” which is the Four Color Theorem.

5. Possible Extensions
	•	Coq or Lean Integration: If you prefer a theorem prover that’s natively verified, you could unify the aggregator approach with an ITP (Interactive Theorem Prover).
	•	Alternative enumerations: Some 4CT proofs use smaller or bigger sets of local patches. You can swap them in to see how the aggregator times differ.
	•	Performance Tuning: The aggregator engine could incorporate heuristics for quickly skipping obviously invalid adjacency patterns or planarity checks.
