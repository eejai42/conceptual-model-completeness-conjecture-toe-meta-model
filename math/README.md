# CMCC Complete Mathematics TOE Meta Model  
### - **[Full Domain List](./../README.md)**

## Overview
A unified meta-model capturing the foundational elements of mathematics, including set theory, arithmetic operations, functions, algebraic structures, logical propositions, and category theory. This model provides a declarative and operational substrate for representing and reasoning about mathematical concepts.

At its core, this model describes how arithmetic emerges from basic set–theoretic constructions and functional mappings. It lays out the ideas behind number systems, the nature of functions as mappings that support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and formalizes algebraic structures (like groups, rings, and fields) through declarative definitions. Logical propositions and categorical abstractions complete the picture by enabling formal proof and high–level abstraction.

### CMCC Complete Mathematics TOE Meta Model
A unified meta-model capturing the foundational elements of mathematics, including set theory, arithmetic operations, functions, algebraic structures, logical propositions, and category theory. This model provides a declarative and operational substrate for representing and reasoning about mathematical concepts.

#### Set
A fundamental collection of mathematical objects. Sets define the universe in which arithmetic and number theory are formulated, with properties such as countability and cardinality that underlie the notion of size and infinity.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **description** (string)
- **countable** (boolean)
- **cardinality** (string)
- **parent_set_id** ()
- **construction_rule** (json)

**Aggregations:**
- **is_empty**: `COUNT(elements) = 0`
- **is_finite**: `countable AND cardinality != 'aleph_0'`

**Lambda Functions:**
- **subset** (Parameters: predicate): `CreateSet(elements.filter(predicate))`
- **power_set** (Parameters: ): `GenerateAllSubsets(this)`

**Constraints:**
- **valid_cardinality**: `cardinality IN ['finite', 'aleph_0', 'aleph_1', 'c']` (Error: Invalid cardinality specification)

#### Element
An atomic or composite member of a Set. Elements are the basic units from which numbers and other mathematical objects are built.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **containing_set_id** ()
- **value_type** (string)
- **value** (json)




---
#### Function
A mapping from a domain Set to a codomain Set. Functions capture the essence of arithmetic operations and other transformations, supporting properties such as injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **domain_set_id** ()
- **codomain_set_id** ()
- **rule** (json)

**Aggregations:**
- **is_injective**: `CheckInjectivity(rule)`
- **is_surjective**: `CheckSurjectivity(rule, codomain_set_id)`
- **is_bijective**: `is_injective AND is_surjective`

**Lambda Functions:**
- **compose** (Parameters: other_function_id): `ComposeRules(this.rule, LOOKUP(other_function_id).rule)`
- **inverse** (Parameters: ): `IF is_bijective THEN InvertRule(rule) ELSE null`


---
#### Structure
An algebraic or mathematical structure defined by a base set, operations, and relations. Examples include groups, rings, and fields, which form the backbone of arithmetic and algebra.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **base_set_id** ()
- **structure_type** (string)
- **operations** (json)
- **relations** (json)

**Aggregations:**
- **is_group**: `CheckGroupAxioms(operations)`
- **is_ring**: `CheckRingAxioms(operations)`
- **is_field**: `CheckFieldAxioms(operations)`



---
#### Proposition
A formal mathematical statement paired with its proof. Propositions enable automated verification of logical reasoning within the model.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **statement** (string)
- **proof_type** (string)
- **proof_steps** (json)
- **depends_on** (json)

**Aggregations:**
- **is_proven**: `ValidateProof(proof_steps)`

**Lambda Functions:**
- **apply** (Parameters: context): `ApplyProposition(this, context)`


---
#### Category
A high-level abstraction grouping mathematical objects and morphisms. Categories provide a unified framework to discuss mathematical structures and their relationships.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **objects** (json)
- **morphisms** (json)

**Aggregations:**
- **is_small**: `IsSetSized(objects)`

**Lambda Functions:**
- **functor** (Parameters: target_category_id): `ConstructFunctor(this, LOOKUP(target_category_id))`

**Constraints:**
- **composition_closed**: `CheckCompositionClosure(morphisms)` (Error: Category must be closed under composition)

## Data Examples

### Sets
- **ℕ**: The natural numbers, forming the basis of arithmetic through inductive construction.
- **ℤ**: The integers, extending the natural numbers to include negatives.
- **ℝ**: The real numbers, encompassing continuous quantities used in calculus and analysis.

### Structures
