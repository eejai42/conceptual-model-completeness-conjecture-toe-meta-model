      "reality_is_the_best_runtime_engine": "Ultimately, for physics for example, reality is the runtime engine.  This just provides the model to understand WHAT is happening at runtime.  Using Airtable to define business rules works for all but the most extreme concepts, but all it defines is exactly WHAT needs to be done.  HOW Airtable works might as well be magic.  I have absolutely no idea HOW it works, but that doesn't really matter since that's not its role in this process.  Its role is to define a high-fidelity, hyper-dimensional model that DEFINES Truth.  On the other end of the spectrum we have Reality Itself, which might as well also be magical, at least at the quantum fringes.  Here again—our models don't describe HOW the wave collapses, but WHAT a wave collapse is.  Or WHAT a Customer is, and WHAT makes them a VIP customer—not how we compute if they are a VIP in some AWS server.  VIP customers are still going to be anyone with over $1000 of sales—that is the part that's invariant.",
      "bright_red_lines": "Separating out WHAT is true from HOW to make it true at runtime draws a BRIGHT RED LINE about what KIND of change is being made.  Additionally, the types of changes that can be made to the model are also separated into two radically different types by another BRIGHT RED LINE.  The first type of change is one where the domain is simply being extended.  In these cases, the CI/CD pipeline will pick up those changes and they will simply be deployed to the dev/test environment.  By contrast, if the domain itself is changed, because changing the schema or rules for a domain is a fundamentally different CATEGORY of change than simply adding another widget to the tens of thousands of widgets that are already in the datastore."
