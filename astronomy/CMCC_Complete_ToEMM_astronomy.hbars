# Astronomy ToE Meta-Model
### 

## Overview
An extension of the Physics TOE to model celestial bodies, star systems, orbital dynamics, and large-scale cosmic structures.

**Schema Overview:**
- **CelestialBody**: Generic celestial object: star, planet, asteroid, etc. References physics Particle or black hole if needed.
- **StarSystem**: Collection of celestial bodies orbiting a primary star. Summaries for total mass, etc.
- **StarSystemMembership**: Bridging table linking CelestialBody to StarSystem with orbital data, etc.
- **Galaxy**: A large-scale structure containing multiple star systems.
