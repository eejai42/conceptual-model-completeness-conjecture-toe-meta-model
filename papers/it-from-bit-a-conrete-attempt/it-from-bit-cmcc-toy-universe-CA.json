      "abstractText": "This work presents the construction of a toy universe grounded in classical logic, elementary natural arithmetic, and a touch of topology. The universe’s space is modeled as a finite, closed, discrete 3-torus with an additional non-spatial dimension of a carefully selected size, effectively creating a layered structure. Two recurring patterns are observed across these layers: one based on the Euclidean distance from a central point, and the other following a half-sinusoidal natural value relative to the same point. These patterns are dynamic, relocating after interactions, allowing for the expansion of spherical wavefronts or information bubbles.\n\nTime in this universe is discrete. Each point within this space contains a fixed-size string of two-state elements, termed exbits (existence bits), each possessing an ontological character. Standard Model particles and relativistic spacetime are hypothesized to emerge from interactions between these layers, where wavefronts are activated as the evolution variables align with both Euclidean and sinusoidal patterns. Electric charge is represented by a single exbit, weak charge by two exbits, and color charge by three exbits.\n\nThe universe’s linear motion (inertia) is governed by one vector, while another vector drives rotational dynamics. Charges conjugate during interactions in intricate ways involving congruence, strong cohesion, attraction/repulsion (Coulomb), and rotation induction (magnetism). Gravity is interpreted as an extension of the static electromagnetic force, resulting in a superdeterministic model reliant on a few input parameters. Energy, conceptualized as the superposition of bubbles, can propagate across the universe, similar to photons, through a fundamental ontological collapse mechanism. This intrinsic non-local energy transfer aligns with quantum physical outcomes without requiring space-like signaling.\n\nAnother intriguing phenomenon explored in this model is self-interference, which arises naturally from the cellular automaton framework. As particles propagate through the discrete lattice, they leave behind a trace of their momentum, effectively imprinting a \"memory\" onto the lattice. This mechanism allows for interactions with subsequent waves, leading to patterns that resemble quantum self-interference. By incorporating this memory effect, the model can reproduce phenomena akin to the double-slit experiment, where particles interfere with their own past paths, reinforcing the emergent behavior of wave-particle duality without invoking any external or non-local mechanisms.\n\nThis constructive approach establishes a universal cellular automaton framework. The research includes computing the Poincaré cycle for a smaller implementation, highlighting the cyclic behavior of entropy. This work is not intended as an interpretation of Quantum Mechanics but rather an attempt to describe nature at a more fundamental level.",
