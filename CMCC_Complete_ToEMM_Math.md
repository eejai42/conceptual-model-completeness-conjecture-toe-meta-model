# The CMCC Complete Theory-of-Everything Meta Model

## Overview
This repo contains a self describing model for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Geology, AI Knowledge Management, Economics and more.  These are all unified under one common CMCC Complete model, a conjecture that posits that the declarative semantics of any conceptual model can be captured using five fundamental primitives—Schema (S), Data (D), Lookups (L), Aggregations (A), and Lambda Calculated Fields (F)—within an ACID-compliant environment. Demonstrating Turing-completeness and aligning with Wolfram’s multiway systems, CMCC provides a universal substrate for modeling domains ranging from physics and biology to business rules and beyond. This paper formalizes CMCC’s theoretical foundations, presents diverse cross-domain examples, and outlines future directions for building a unified computational framework



## Mathematical Schema
### CMCC Complete Mathematics TOE Meta Model

CMCC Complete Mathematics TOE Meta Model

### Set
A fundamental collection of mathematical objects. Sets define the universe in which arithmetic and number theory are formulated, with properties such as countability and cardinality that underlie the notion of size and infinity.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **description** (string)
- **countable** (boolean)
- **cardinality** (string)
- **parent_set_id** ()
- **construction_rule** (json)

### Element
An atomic or composite member of a Set. Elements are the basic units from which numbers and other mathematical objects are built.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **containing_set_id** ()
- **value_type** (string)
- **value** (json)

### Function
A mapping from a domain Set to a codomain Set. Functions capture the essence of arithmetic operations and other transformations, supporting properties such as injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **domain_set_id** ()
- **codomain_set_id** ()
- **rule** (json)

### Structure
An algebraic or mathematical structure defined by a base set, operations, and relations. Examples include groups, rings, and fields, which form the backbone of arithmetic and algebra.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **base_set_id** ()
- **structure_type** (string)
- **operations** (json)
- **relations** (json)

### Proposition
A formal mathematical statement paired with its proof. Propositions enable automated verification of logical reasoning within the model.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **statement** (string)
- **proof_type** (string)
- **proof_steps** (json)
- **depends_on** (json)

### Category
A high-level abstraction grouping mathematical objects and morphisms. Categories provide a unified framework to discuss mathematical structures and their relationships.

**Fields:**
- **id** (string)
- **name** (string)
- **objects** (json)
- **morphisms** (json)


## Data Examples

### Sets
- **ℕ**: The natural numbers, forming the basis of arithmetic through inductive construction.
- **ℤ**: The integers, extending the natural numbers to include negatives.
- **ℝ**: The real numbers, encompassing continuous quantities used in calculus and analysis.

### Structures
- **Ring of Integers**: An algebraic structure that formalizes addition and multiplication over the set of integers.
